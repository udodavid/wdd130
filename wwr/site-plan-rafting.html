            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Imagine that you are the owner of the rafting business and have decided that it is time for you to have an online presence. What is the purpose? You might need to do a little research if you are unfamiliar with water rafting companies.</p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>Write a statement specifically identifying your target audience for a water rafting website. Review the example questions posed about target audiences from the learning activity on site plan sections. Include three (3) scenario questions. Include both the scenario questions and answers to those questions.</p>
            <h2>Branding</h2>
            <h3>Website Logo</h3>
            <img src="images/rafting-logo.jpg" alt="Rafting Site Logo">
            <p>Choose or create a logo for your website. Here are some example logos that you can use freely - Rafting Logos.</p>
            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
            <h3>Color Palette</h3>
            <p>Using the coolors.co tool, choose a color scheme for your rafting site, keeping your site purpose and audience in mind. Start by thinking of a color you like or think will work well for a rafting site.
                Once you have built your palette, note that at the bottom of each color column there is a six digit hex code. This is what is known as a hexadecimal color code (base 16 or 0 to F) and is usually preceded by a "#". Copy that code for the 3–4 colors you would like to use into the site plan document.
                List the colors you have selected in the site plan paragraph using a structure of your choice below the color palette heading. Include the 'name' of the color (given below) and the hexadecimal color code. These are the four (4) labeled 'names' that we will use in the CSS.</p>
            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <h4>Headings Example Font</h4>
            <h4>Normal Text/Paragraph Example Font</h4>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>
            <h4>Colored Callout Example Font</h4>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>
